**DONT REINVENT THE WEEL**
--------------------------

Modafoka! Use a available game engine!

---

Every game I made can be played on desktop and mobile web browsers (http://games.jessefreeman.com)

### Why make one game / month?

1. Quickly explore and prototype ideas
1. Focus on core features
1. Lear to work under pressure
1. Find motiviation to complete a game
1. Force yourself to release the game


Talent is cheaper than table salt

### Create, refine, iterate

- is a never ending process
- is hard to accept your games aren't fun to play

Continue refine your game until you find what works.

**NEVER GIVE UP**

### Desing for mobile first

Desing for 16:9 and 4:3 and ajust with bars

- 1076x600 (13366x768)
- 800x600

**Optimize**
Use power 2 for textures
Combine as sprites into one texture

### Automate everything

- optimize and package
- deploy to multiple platforms
- reproducible build process

### Analyze your game

- What's going on in your game
- Track game screens

in one mnoth
- 19k started
- 7k finish
- 634 hit quit button

only 38.79% finish the game! :(

Identify the dropoff

Iregular data shows bugs

### Release early, release often

People just want a fun game, don't care of graphics or stuff

The more games you make the better you get at it.

Long tail - usage after launch boom

Is still a work in process

- Web
- CocoonJS
- Phonegap (audio issues on android)
- [Amazon web apps](https://developer.amazon.com/webapps) (focused on kindle users)


### Perfection

Not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.
