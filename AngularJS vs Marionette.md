AngularJS
---------

#### Pros

 * Double binding
 * No DOM manipulation
 * Excellent module separation
 * Fast development

#### Nons

 * Excellent template helpers (directives)
   * but looks complex 
 * ng-boilerplate provides
   * autoexecutable TDD
   * autoexecutable build
   * unusable without build

#### Cons

 * Custom way to do everything (ng-click, ng-class, ng-...)
 * Need to learn $scope behaviour
 * Needs a new build system since RequireJS is redundant
 * Will be adaptable to every need?
 * So much magic


Marionette

 * Learn architecture
 * Message bus (emit, request, execute)
 * RequireJS - Marionette - Handlebars - i18n boilerplate 
 * Can use handlebars helpers
