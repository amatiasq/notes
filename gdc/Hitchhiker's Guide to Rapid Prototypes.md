[Hitchhiker's Guide to Rapid Prototypes!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYWkiv1hTPM)

Development is not a set of ladders. Prototypes let you test more than a single role.

### Define rapid prototype

Minimum Viable Product leaves you with uncompleted project until the end.

Minimum Viable Interaction gives you a different project on each step.

# Disclaimer

> This is my opinion, hope you find yours.

## Urgent or important?

Urgent is:
- current
- choice
- complete a task

Important is:
- Evolving
- Plan
- Meaningful change

A important gol gives you a direction. The urgents are putting out big fire.

Use big fires as a tool to guide you to your important goal.

If you're working on an un-planed goal, chances are you're working on an urgent goal.

If goal is urgent just **resist** the impulse to react. Think about it and turn it into something closer to your important goal.

## S.M.A.R.T.

goal

- Specific: Precise description of what is to be acomplished
- Measurable: Progress is visible and tracked
- Attainable: What actions are needed to make it happen
- Relevant: How is your goal meaningful and realistic
- Time-bound: What is the estimated time for completion

## Strategy

A plan to achieve our goal
A plan of action, carefully designed, to achieve our goal

- deliverables
- features
- functions
- tasks
- deadlines
- costs

Narrow down to scope

Bad scope is never on propose. Usually is EGO being normal in a healthy person.

### Ego

Ego has the power of disregarding anything that doesn't want to consider.
Has blind spot for everything else.
Won't see barriers outside of our goal.
Those barriers have an impact anyway.
Ego it too fragile to handle barriers.

Ego is the need to finish the program?

### Humility

Humility is quiet

Can fill internal barriers:
- attitude
- emotions
- understanding
- creativity
- skill

Will spot external barriers:
- time
- resources
- location
- oportunity
- competition

Awknowledge your barriers won't keep you from working at (insert awesome studio here).
But will keep you from try to match the level of production of (repeat awesome studio).

#### Story about a guy

He had barriers and he used them as part of his creation instead of
- a reason to start
- or a reason to not start

Start where you are
Use what you've got
Do what you can

# Vision

## Game concept

- General or specific
- Capture theme
- Highlight goal
- Describe user experience
- Inspire insterest and desire

## **Possible** implementation

- Quick and dirty
- Easy to understand
- Format specific
- Scope appropiate

### [What is the core mechanic of your class](https://the8blog.wordpress.com/2014/10/14/what-is-the-core-mechanic-of-your-class/)

Core mechanic => Secondary Mechanics => Progression => Narrative or "Hero mith"

- Core mechanic: Most frequent proposeful interaction
- Secondary mechanics: Less frequent interactions
- Progression: Conditions required for progress
- Narrative: Context for overall goal

### IE Pacman

~Eat => Chase => Clear mazes => Eat or be eaten~
Move => Eat => Clear mazes => Eat or be eaten

## asdf

If you inspire and have possible design

# Process

The invisible tracks on which the development train runs, makes everything faster, a lot less bumpy.
It's the small sacrifices we make for greater good as Exercise or Eat Healhy.

is an inherently personal thing that we try to pull of the shelf
what parts of different process are working for you

## [Sprint by Jake Knapp](https://www.thesprintbook.com/)

A process of just one week

- Monday: make a map of the problem and pick a target
  - start at the end
  - ask the experts
  - target

- Tuesday: work on a proposal separately
  - Remix & improve

- Wednesday: decide (pick a proposal)
  - Rumble
  - Storyboard

- Thursday: Prototype
  - ask the experts
  - I had to expand it to 4 days

- Friday: test with users

### IE

- long term goal
- sprint questions to be answered
- Draw simple sketches
- create photoshop example from google images
- build a prototype
- coder friend helped with project
- user testing
- survey monkey

# Summary

- Be resourceful, not a resource
- Optmize for interaction, not ideas
- Goals are your fundation, make them strong
- Scope with widsdom, not wishes
- Vision is a lot of work, no just an idea
- Process is necessary
