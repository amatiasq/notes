[Mini Metro: When Less is More](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmHXk4Y35QM)

# Key mechanic

- observe
- experiment
- discovery

The most basic idea behind the game:

- survive
- building
- test

Everthing else is secondary

# Tutorial

The game should be introduced step by step, small feature after small feature.

[Feature flags?](feature-flags)

# Game UI things to keep in mind:

Simplify rules vs complex simulation

Be the world's worst magician: Make the user look at the place where things are happening.

- avoid any extraneus visual reward: don't display the same notification in two places

# Takeaways

- understand your game (can be intuitive or explicit)
- design UI and UX to support and enhance this
- be mindful of what your UI emphasises
- trust your players (they can learn on they own)
- build a visual language
- iterate

# where do you get test players

- first test round watching people play
- cuando se lo muestre a alguien tengo que ver si lo entiende


- quizás no tiene sentido hacer Catastrophe basado en el PEM
