[Sid Meier's Psychology of Game Design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtzCLd93SyU)

###  gameplay is a psicological experience

el problema de hacerlo realista es que te demuestra que todo lo que crees saber está mal

- egomanía: build a civilization that stand the test of time
- paranoia
- delusion
- self-destructive behaviour

# winner paradox

- player always wins
- guide the player to replayability (next time try doing...)

# rules of game design

- the first 15 minutes should be compelling, fun, foreshadow what is comming (use rewards?)

#### 4 difficulty levels

**WRONG USE LEVELS AS REWARD**

- ~introduce player (always win)~
- ~casual~
- ~experienced~
- ~ultimate challenge~

# UNHOLY ALLIANCE

concept invented by Sid Meier

Player a game agree on pretending some things and together we will have a great experience

- style should fit in the game
  - ej. si el juego empieza cartoony and terrible things start to happen
- give the player a little ventaja
  - player chances 3 / 4 should be always win
    - roll dices done in average (1 vs 3 should be 5 50% battles)
    - 2:1 chances to win
    - don't loose 2 2:1 in a row
- any kind of randomness should be treated with a lot of care
  - random awakes paranoia

## dev pretends

- the player is really good (flight simulators) for fun
- avoid moral dilemmas (WTF Sid???)

## player pretends

- suspend of disbelief: they play our game

## cold war

- the player can leave the game and break the deal
- the dev can throw the player time

# AAA Game

- use player imagination for what he wants to imagine, use money for everything else
- tap into what the player already knows (no!)

# IA

for sid it's just one more element in the experience

it's really hard. there's a fine line between clever and wrong
if it's actually clever the game cheated

IA is a metric for the player to learn
IA should react to player actions and understand them

# Protect the player from themselves

- load / save issues
  - if to easy might dimish experience
  - embed it into the fantasy
- don't give player mechanic settings
- cheats should be hidden
- modding is good

# listen to player

- don't take literally
- get value from the change they propose
- emotions are comments
- know they personality
