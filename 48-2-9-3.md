Basic math operators priority: 

 - brackets
 - powers and roots
 - multiplication and division
 - addition and subtraction
 - OPERATOR AT THE LEFT

    48 / 2 (9 + 3) = 48 / 2 * 12

As division and multiplication have same priority the operator at the left should be calculed first

    (48 / 2) * 12 = 24 * 12 = 288

The same applies without resolving the brackets and using distributive property

    48 / 2 * (9 + 3)

As multiplication and division have same priority the operator at the left should be calculed first

    (48 / 2) * (9 + 3) = (48 / 2) * 9 + (48 / 2) * 3 = 24 * 9 + 24 * 3 = 216 + 72 = 288

If we use commutative property we can switch the multiplication keeping in mind than the division should be calculed first because it's at the left so we can't break it and should add the brakets because we are switching the operators

    48 / 2 * (9 + 3) = (9 + 3) * (48 / 2) = 12 * 24 = 288

Maths are perfects, but you must know the rules. Greetings from Spain.
