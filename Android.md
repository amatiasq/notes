### Principles:

- Enchant me
  - Delight me in surprising ways
  - Real objects are more fun than buttons and menus
  - Let me make it mine (personalize)
  - Get to know me (learn from the user)

- Simplify my life
  - Keep it brief
  - Pictures are faster than words
  - Decide for me but let me have the final say
  - Only show what I need when I need it
  - I should always know where I am (transitions and feedback)
  - Never lose my stuff (settings)
  - If it looks the same, it should act the same
  - Only interrupt me if it's important

- Make me amazing
  - Give me tricks that work everywhere
  - It's not my fault (make the user feel smart)
  - Sprinkle encouragement (little steps)
  - Do the heavy lifting for me
  - Make important things fast

**States**
  - Normal
  - Pressed (darkens, lightens on dark themes)
  - Focused (iuminates with color)
  - Disabled (draws 30% of normal state)
